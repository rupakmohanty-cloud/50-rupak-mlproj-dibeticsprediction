# Project Background :


# Project Overview :

Dataset is downloaded from Kaggle. 

The objective of this article is to build a predictive machine learning model to predict based on diagnostic measurements whether a patient has diabetes. This is a binary (2-class) classification problem. There are 768 observations with 8 medical predictor variables (input) and 1 target variable (output 0 for "no" or 1 for "yes").

## Project Layout :

This project was worked in the following steps:

	1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
	2. Prepare the Data
	3. Split Dataset
	4. Baseline Model
	5. Transformation Pipelines
	6. Short-list Promising Models
	7. Fine-Tune the Potential Models
	8. Permutation Importance
	9. Using Plots to Explain Predictions for Final Model
